              Jake (full title: Jake the Dog) is one of the main characters of Adventure Time. He is a dog/shape-shifter hybrid, referred to by others as a "magical dog," and Finn's constant companion, best friend, and adoptive brother.

            <br>
            <p>
              Jake has a unique set of abilities called Stretchy Powers that allow him to manipulate the shape and size of his body, coming in handy on innumerable occasions throughout his and Finn's adventures. Jake was 28 years old at his debut in "magical dog years," and ages throughout the series, though he rarely acts mature. It is inferred that magical dogs have a lifespan similar to Humans, as demonstrated by an aged Jake in "Dungeon Train." Then again, how exactly magical dog years correlate to human years remains to be seen, although both Finn and Jake were shown to be babies around the same time, showing that they age slightly faster, however, his age as of "Joshua and Margaret Investigations" suggests that it slows down to the rate of human's aging at some point. Jake is currently in a relationship with Lady Rainicorn, and, by "Jake the Dad," they are the parents of five Rainicorn-dog hybrids.

               on the head. Jake was later born from the pustule that formed from the bite on his father's head and was taken in by Joshua and Margaret to live alongside their natural-born son Jermaine. It is inferred that Jake's Stretchy Powers that he has had since he was a puppy are a result of his biological relationship with the shape-shifting creature, although Jake himself never learned this until the creature (revealing his name to be Warren Ampersand) returned in "Jake the Starchild." Before this point, Jake believed he had gained his powers from rolling in mud as a puppy.[1] Little is revealed of Jake's past with his family. At some point, when Jake and Jermaine were still infants, Joshua and Margaret found a human baby named Finn abandoned in the woods, raising him as their own. Jake would develop a lifelong friendship with Finn over the years. Joshua was known to push his three sons to be tough, while Margaret was often more protective and nurturing towards them. Jake regardless generally holds fond memories of being raised by them in their old house.

              Sometime around Joshua and Margaret's deaths, Jake moved into the Tree Fort with Finn while Jermaine stayed at their parents' house. For a while, Jake was known to be a successful criminal until he retired to take part in a more respectable life as an adventurer with Finn, later settling down with Lady Rainicorn to become a father.
